This is a proposal for a decentralized educational system. 

Anyone is free to work on the ideas contained here. However we'd like to request you do so publicly. Education concerns everyone and everyone should be able to know what's going on. 

Any critiques of the idea can be brought up as Issues in this repo or emailed to jared(at)otlw.co 

This page was built using <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a> by Dave Liepmann using ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte. Any design critque can be dealt with as above.
