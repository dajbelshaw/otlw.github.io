      <h2>The necessity of a new educational system</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">A decentralized system </span> of education and assessment would provide the foundation for a truly meritocratic society. </p>
      <p>Centralized learning institutions provide curricula that limit students and standardized assessments that are inaccurate and ineffective.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Large monolithic curricula don't target users' specific skills and abilities, forcing them to learn large amounts of knowledge that may not be necessary for their particular goals. Assessments do the same and have to take into account honesty which affect their accuracy.</span> The teacher-student divide within classical education is resource intensive and inefficient,<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The 20:1 student teacher ratio means that teachers will always be scarce, and will also be unable to deal with student specific needs. Lose, Lose.</span>
      hugely limiting the amount of students an institution can support and depriving many students globally of an effective education. The overall result of these flaws is a sacrifice of the freedom for individuals to choose their own educational paths. </p>

      <p>These problems can be overcome by a decentralized network based on user set goals and peer assessment by those with valid experience. The classroom and course structure can be replaced by a system in which all users function as both students and assessors.</p>

      <h2>Assessment, goals, and users</h2>

      <p><span class="newthought">Because vetting</span> individual assessors is expensive and inefficient we can instead use multiple assessments from motivated assessors. Each must give individual scores<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The score is likely to be best in a 1-100 format so as to force more precise assessments of users. Note that there always has to be an odd number of assessors so that either a pass or fail can be determiend from them.</span> and a pass/ fail grade, while having no communication with any of the others. The average of the assessments is accepted as the user’s score and assessors with assessments close to that score are awarded tokens<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">These tokens will only be split between those who are in the majority on the pass/fail grade.</span> which are used, in turn by these assessors, to initiate assessments of themselves. All assessors must put up a stake of tokens before assessment to add negative reinforcement and to ensure their presence. The payout for assessment would also scale with this stake.<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">To initiate an assessment requires a certain minimum of tokens. This is so that users will never be without tokens to put up for stake and so will always be able to assess in order to gain more.</sidenote> As such, all users are required to play both roles; paying forward their previous educational experiences to attest to those of others.</p>

      <p>These assessments can be trusted because it is in the assessor's best interest to be accurate so that they: are closer to the average, rewarded,<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">This is a focal point which the assessors will gravitate towards. The creation of other focal points is prevented by the assessors lack of knowledge on each other.</span> and can continue to participate in the system. Trust is built over time as more and more information is added to the system on individuals, each attested to by previous assessments.</p>

      <p>As powerful personal growth often comes from collaboration with others, users in the system can pool their tokens for assessment into learning-contracts.<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> The number of assessors for groups is based on the size of the group and the number of assessors available, while the assessors for single users is only based on the latter.</span>These guarantee that they will work together and have a stake in their overall success.  Users would initially define their own goals before being paired<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">Users would submit their group request to the blockchain at which point miners would group the users with similar requests. Users would have to submit each block until successfully paired.</span> and then the group as a whole would define their goal, which is what would be assessed. Groups can provide support and mentorship, or simply camaraderie in the same task. They can even function to break down goals impossible for a single user into doable chunks for the individual members. This makes them a robust tool for skill acquisition and for gaining new experiences. </p>

      <p>These experiences are defined, by the users themselves before assessment, through tags. The more a tag is used throughout the system; the more general it is, the less; the more specific.<label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The tag "Math" will be much more frequently used than the tag "Algebra" meaning that "Math" is the general tag and "Algebra" is the specific tag.</span>
       Assessors are paired with users based on tags they’ve previously completed, specific tags having priority, so that users with the most pertinent knowledge are assessing. </p>

       <p>This entire system, however, depends on having user information already in the system. An influx of new users at any time could cripple the networks efficacy. New users, therefore, can only be created through consensus from multiple users of a certain standing within the network. It will cost users tokens to create new one’s, though, so that they do not abuse that power. These tokens are transferred to the new user’s account, but not at a 1:1 ratio. New users would also be created with a small amount of general data (read: tags) to allow them to assess goals.</p>

       <p>Over time as data builds, the system will become more efficient at pairing users and could become a powerful tool for initiating collaboration without previous contact. The same would also apply for assessment which would become more accurate as time goes on. With more data and accurate assessment the network as a whole gets stronger and more powerful for all users.</p>

      <h2>Why a decentralized design</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">Education is </span> a human right and must be accessible to all along with opportunities for personal growth and the ability to testify to that growth. Decentralization removes the central authority that could impose limitations or even censorship onto the system and ensures this accessibility, only requiring computer access for each assessment.<label for="11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The current system is relatively decentralized on the institution level, albeit with institutions often sharing centralized standards, but not on the learning level.</span> It allows individuals to define their own goals and have their achievements attested to by other individuals, without any predetermined tests or monolithic curriculum. It also removes any individual power to purchase better educational opportunities, as everyone must be an equal participant; having access to all opportunities within the system. </p>

      <p>A meritocracy functions on these elements, accurate unbiased reporting and equal opportunity for all. Our system can support a meritocratic system such as an institution making a hire by providing a categorized system of verifiable achievements. With this system individuals and institutions can prove both that they and others have certain credentials in an open and secure way. Because it is open data everyone has access and organizations and individuals can be held accountable for decisions based on it. </p>

      <h2> How to decentralize the system</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">The blockchain</span> provides a perfect platform for this system. It is a distributed ledger that is secured through consensus,<label for="12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">The most well tested and secure protocol for consensus is Proof-of-Work as implemented in the Bitcoin Protocol.</span> and as such provides a reliable data store for achievements arrived at through consensus. It requires no vetting or trusted parties to maintain the network and can be easily accessed through the network. The blockchain is secured through miners,<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote"> Miners are essentially bookkeepers who collect transactions and then attempt to create blocks satisfying certain requirements agreed upon by the network. A miner who succeeds is rewarded with new coins or value.</span> users who collect “transactions”, in our case achievements and assessments, into blocks which are then secured into the chain through investment of computational power based on all the blocks before them. This means that to change a transaction in the chain you also need to modify all the blocks based on it, reinvesting all the computational resources. This means users cannot remove or rectify mistakes or history on the chain. This makes it an ideal candidate for a long term, secure, and verifiable educational system. If the entire network agrees on the same rules this allows it to dynamically control all elements, such as coin supply, through assessor payouts and new user creation, through the tokens or experience required.</p>

      <h2> The potential for society</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">The long term </span> goal is the foundation of a fair, just, and meritocratic society, in which individuals, regardless of personal factors, have the freedom to learn and grow with each other, judged solely on individual achievements. The society would function on a ruleset unalterable by any malicious centralized power, categorizing the skillsets of each individual and giving others the information necessary to place those individuals within society. This provides the basis for a society based on action and fact, with each individual serving their best role in the larger whole.</p>

      <h2> What now and how</h2>
      <p><span class="newthought">We are not</span> developers. We are not experts in pedagogy or cryptography or sociology, or economy. We are students, believers in the potential for a better educational system. Our intent is to start a discussion on the ideas suggested here.We want people who are developers and teachers,and cryptographers and sociologists, to give input, to change and develop everything we’ve come up with. To get people who have power and influence to support and begin to build a system that will make the world a better place. Our hope in writing this lightpaper is that people will see it as a starting point, a very modest platform to build on, to create a better educational system that could be the foundation for a better society.</p>
